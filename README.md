Orchestrate AI coding agents across multiple repositories.

Uses GitHub Issues as the communication layer, Podman containers as the execution environment, and [opencode](https://opencode.ai) as the agent runtime. Environments are managed with [Nix](https://nixos.org) and [agentkit](https://github.com/ungood/agentkit).

**Status:** Planning. See [docs/plan.md](docs/plan.md) for the full project plan.
